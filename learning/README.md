# Continuous Learning Integration System

## Overview

The Continuous Learning Integration System is a comprehensive framework that enables organizational-level learning and continuous improvement for the Agile AI Company. This system aggregates learnings from multiple sources, triggers behavior evolution, optimizes workflows, and improves templates based on experience.

## Architecture

The system consists of two main components:

### 1. Organizational Learning (`organizational_learning.py`)
Manages enterprise-wide learning aggregation and knowledge synthesis:
- **Learning Aggregation**: Collects learnings from teams, agents, workflows, retrospectives, incidents, experiments, customer feedback, and performance metrics
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies organizational patterns and insights across multiple learning sources
- **Behavior Evolution**: Triggers agent behavior updates based on high-impact learnings
- **Workflow Evolution**: Optimizes workflows based on identified patterns
- **Knowledge Base Management**: Updates and distributes organizational knowledge
- **Template Improvement**: Enhances templates based on usage patterns

### 2. Behavior Evolution (`behavior_evolution.py`)
Implements intelligent behavior adaptation and optimization:
- **Behavior Tracking**: Monitors agent behavior performance across multiple dimensions
- **Evolution Strategies**: Applies reinforcement, mutation, crossover, pruning, adaptation, and innovation
- **Workflow Optimization**: Removes redundancies, parallelizes steps, and reorders for efficiency
- **Template Enhancement**: Analyzes usage patterns to improve template effectiveness
- **Performance Measurement**: Calculates fitness scores and tracks evolution progress

## Key Features

### Learning Sources
- **Team Sources**: Retrospectives, team reports, collaboration metrics
- **Agent Sources**: Individual agent experiences and performance
- **Workflow Sources**: Execution patterns, bottlenecks, optimization opportunities
- **Customer Sources**: Feedback, satisfaction metrics, usage patterns
- **Performance Sources**: Metrics analysis, trend identification, anomaly detection

### Evolution Mechanisms
- **Reinforcement**: Strengthens successful behavior patterns
- **Mutation**: Introduces random variations for exploration
- **Crossover**: Combines successful behaviors from different agents
- **Innovation**: Creates novel behavior patterns
- **Adaptation**: Adjusts to environmental changes
- **Pruning**: Removes underperforming behaviors

### Quality Assurance
- **Validation**: Multi-level validation of learnings and evolutions
- **Rollback**: Automatic rollback mechanisms for failed evolutions
- **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of evolution effectiveness
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all learning and evolution activities

## Installation

```bash
# The learning system is part of the Agent-Zero framework
# Ensure you have the required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Import the learning system
from learning.organizational_learning import OrganizationalLearning
from learning.behavior_evolution import BehaviorEvolution
```

## Quick Start

### Basic Organizational Learning

```python
import asyncio
from datetime import timedelta
from learning.organizational_learning import OrganizationalLearning, LearningSource

async def main():
    # Initialize the system
    org_learning = OrganizationalLearning()
    
    # Aggregate learnings from the past week
    learnings = await org_learning.aggregate_learnings(
        sources=[LearningSource.TEAM, LearningSource.RETROSPECTIVE],
        time_window=timedelta(days=7)
    )
    
    print(f"Aggregated {len(learnings)} learnings")
    
    # Update behaviors based on learnings
    evolutions = await org_learning.update_behaviors(learnings)
    print(f"Created {len(evolutions)} behavior evolutions")
    
    # Generate comprehensive report
    report = org_learning.generate_learning_report()
    print(report)

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Basic Behavior Evolution

```python
import asyncio
from learning.behavior_evolution import BehaviorEvolution, BehaviorType, EvolutionStrategy

async def main():
    # Initialize the evolution system
    evolution = BehaviorEvolution()
    
    # Track agent behavior
    behavior = await evolution.track_behavior(
        agent_id="agent_001",
        behavior_type=BehaviorType.PROBLEM_SOLVING,
        parameters={'approach': 'analytical', 'depth': 3},
        outcome='success',
        metrics={'efficiency': 0.8, 'quality': 0.9}
    )
    
    print(f"Tracked behavior: {behavior.name} (fitness: {behavior.fitness_score:.3f})")
    
    # Evolve behaviors using mixed strategy
    evolved = await evolution.evolve_behaviors(strategy=EvolutionStrategy.REINFORCEMENT)
    print(f"Evolved {len(evolved)} behaviors")
    
    # Get best performing behaviors
    best_behaviors = evolution.get_best_behaviors(top_n=5)
    for i, behavior in enumerate(best_behaviors, 1):
        print(f"{i}. {behavior.name}: {behavior.fitness_score:.3f}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

```

## Learning Sources Integration

### Team Learning Collection
```python
async def collect_team_learnings(self, cutoff_time: datetime):
    # Integrate with team orchestrator
    # Collect from retrospectives, reports, metrics
    pass
```

### Agent Learning Collection

    pass
```

## Evolution Strategies

### 1. Reinforcement Learning
Strengthens behaviors that consistently perform well:
```python
# High-performing behaviors get reinforced parameters
reinforced_params = {param: value * 1.1 for param, value in original_params.items()}
```

### 2. Genetic Algorithm Components
- **Selection**: Fitness-based selection of parent behaviors
- **Crossover**: Parameter mixing between successful behaviors
- **Mutation**: Random parameter variations for exploration
- **Elite Preservation**: Keeping top performers across generations

### 3. Adaptive Evolution
- **Environment Detection**: Monitors performance trends
- **Adaptive Parameters**: Adjusts evolution rates based on success
- **Context Awareness**: Considers situational factors in evolution

## Workflow Optimization

### Redundancy Removal
```python
def remove_redundant_steps(self, steps):
    # Identify and remove duplicate workflow steps
    unique_steps = []
    seen = set()
    for step in steps:
        step_key = json.dumps(step, sort_keys=True)
        if step_key not in seen:
            seen.add(step_key)
            unique_steps.append(step)
    return unique_steps
```

### Parallelization
```python
def parallelize_steps(self, steps):
    # Identify independent steps that can run in parallel
    for step in steps:
        step['parallel'] = 'dependencies' not in step
    return steps
```

### Reordering
```python
def reorder_steps(self, steps):
    # Optimize step order for efficiency
    return sorted(steps, key=lambda s: s.get('duration', 0))
```

## Template Improvement

### Usage Analysis
```python
def analyze_template_usage(self, usage_data):
    improvements = {}
    
    # Identify unused sections
    if 'unused_sections' in usage_data:
        improvements['remove_sections'] = usage_data['unused_sections']
    
    # Identify frequently added custom fields
    if 'custom_fields' in usage_data:
        field_frequency = Counter(usage_data['custom_fields'])
        common_fields = [f for f, count in field_frequency.items() if count > 5]
        if common_fields:
            improvements['add_fields'] = common_fields
    
    return improvements
```

## Performance Metrics

### Behavior Fitness Calculation
```python
@property
def fitness_score(self) -> float:
    weights = {
        'success_rate': 0.4,
        'efficiency': 0.3,
        'quality': 0.2,
        'usage': 0.1
    }
    
    score = 0.0
    score += weights['success_rate'] * self.success_rate
    score += weights['efficiency'] * self.performance_metrics.get('efficiency', 0.5)
    score += weights['quality'] * self.performance_metrics.get('quality', 0.5)
    
    # Sigmoid function for usage normalization
    usage_score = 1 / (1 + math.exp(-0.01 * self.usage_count))
    score += weights['usage'] * usage_score
    
    return min(1.0, max(0.0, score))
```

### Learning Impact Assessment
- **Impact Score**: Quantifies the potential benefit of applying a learning
- **Confidence Level**: Measures certainty in the learning's validity
- **Application Success**: Tracks successful implementations
- **ROI Calculation**: Measures return on investment for learning applications
