# Metrics and Performance Layer

## Overview
The Metrics Layer provides comprehensive performance monitoring, quality tracking, and business intelligence for the Agile AI Company framework. This layer enables data-driven decision making and continuous optimization.

## Components

### Performance Monitor (`performance_monitor.py`)
- Tracks system-wide performance metrics
- Monitors agent response times
- Measures task completion rates
- Detects performance anomalies

### Resource Tracker (`resource_tracker.py`)
- Monitors CPU, memory, and network usage
- Tracks resource consumption by team
- Identifies resource bottlenecks
- Provides capacity planning data

### Quality Tracker (`quality_tracker.py`)
- Monitors code quality metrics
- Tracks defect rates and severity
- Measures test coverage
- Evaluates output quality

### Agile Metrics (`agile_metrics.py`)
- Calculates team velocity
- Tracks sprint metrics
- Measures cycle and lead time
- Monitors throughput

### Velocity Tracker (`velocity_tracker.py`)
- Historical velocity analysis
- Velocity trend prediction
- Capacity planning support
- Team comparison metrics

### Compliance Tracker (`compliance_tracker.py`)
- Monitors ethical compliance
- Tracks safety violations
- Generates compliance reports
- Maintains audit metrics

### Learning Tracker (`learning_tracker.py`)
- Tracks organizational learning
- Measures knowledge retention
- Monitors skill development
- Evaluates learning effectiveness
