# Coordination Layer

## Overview
The Coordination Layer manages team orchestration, workflow execution, and inter-agent communication for the Agile AI Company framework. This layer acts as the central coordinator for all multi-agent activities.

## Components

### Team Orchestrator (`team_orchestrator.py`)
- Manages dynamic team formation and dissolution
- Allocates agents from the pool based on requirements
- Monitors team performance and health
- Handles team reorganization and scaling

### Workflow Engine (`workflow_engine.py`)
- Parses and executes YAML workflow definitions
- Manages workflow state and transitions
- Implements conditional branching logic
- Tracks workflow progress and completion

### Document Manager (`document_manager.py`)
- Handles document flow between agents
- Manages version control and access permissions
- Implements document handoff protocols
- Maintains document registry and relationships

### Agent Pool (`agent_pool.py`)
- Maintains pool of available agents
- Matches agent capabilities to requirements
- Handles agent allocation and release
- Manages agent lifecycle and health

### Learning Synthesizer (`learning_synthesizer.py`)
- Aggregates learning across teams
- Identifies patterns and insights
- Updates organizational knowledge base
- Distributes learnings to relevant agents

## Workflows

Workflow definitions are stored in `/workflows/` directory:
- Greenfield development workflows
