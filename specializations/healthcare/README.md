from specializations.healthcare import HealthcareSpecialization

# Initialize with HIPAA configuration
healthcare = HealthcareSpecialization()
healthcare.load_configuration()

# Create clinical team
clinical_team = healthcare.create_clinical_team()

# Execute patient data workflow
result = healthcare.execute_workflow('patient_data_processing', patient_info)
```

## Privacy and Security
