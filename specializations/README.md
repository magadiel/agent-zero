## How to Use Specializations

### 1. Load a Specialization

```python
from specializations.loader import SpecializationLoader

# Load fintech specialization
loader = SpecializationLoader()
fintech = loader.load_specialization('fintech')

# Apply specialization to agent system
fintech.apply_to_system()
```

### 2. Create Industry-Specific Teams

```python
# Create a compliance team for fintech
compliance_team = fintech.create_team('compliance', {
    'compliance_officer': 1,
    'risk_analyst': 1,
    'financial_product_manager': 1
})

# Execute industry workflow
result = fintech.execute_workflow('kyc_onboarding', customer_data)
```

### 3. Configure Industry Settings

```python
# Get industry-specific configuration
config = fintech.get_configuration()

# Apply enhanced ethics constraints
ethics_engine.load_constraints(config.ethics)

# Configure safety thresholds
safety_monitor.load_thresholds(config.safety)
```

## Creating New Specializations

### Step 1: Define Industry Requirements

1. **Identify Key Roles**: What agent roles are needed?
2. **Map Business Processes**: What workflows are critical?
3. **Understand Compliance**: What regulations apply?
4. **Define Success Metrics**: How is success measured?
5. **Assess Integration Needs**: What external systems integrate?

### Step 2: Create Specialization Structure

```bash
# Create new specialization directory
mkdir -p specializations/[industry]/{config,agents,workflows,templates,checklists,docs}

# Copy template files
cp specializations/_template/* specializations/[industry]/
```

### Step 3: Customize Configuration

Edit `config/specialization.yaml`:

```yaml
name: "[Industry] Specialization"
version: "1.0.0"
description: "Industry-specific configuration for [industry]"

metadata:
  industry: "[Industry Name]"
  compliance_frameworks: [...]
  focus_areas: [...]

ethics:
  [industry]_constraints: [...]

safety:
  [industry]_thresholds: [...]

resource_allocation: [...]
audit: [...]
integrations: [...]
```

### Step 4: Create Agent Profiles

For each agent, create a BMAD-style profile:

```markdown
# [Agent Name] Agent

```yaml
activation-instructions: [...]
agent: [...]
persona: [...]
commands: [...]
dependencies: [...]
```

## Key Responsibilities
## Quality Standards
```

### Step 5: Define Workflows

Create YAML workflow definitions:

```yaml
name: "[Workflow Name]"
description: "[Workflow Description]"
metadata: [...]
sequence: [...]
quality_gates: [...]
escalations: [...]
```

### Step 6: Add Templates and Checklists

- Create document templates in YAML format
- Define quality checklists in Markdown
- Add any industry-specific forms or procedures

### Step 7: Test and Validate

```python
# Test specialization loading
loader = SpecializationLoader()
new_spec = loader.load_specialization('[industry]')

# Validate configuration
new_spec.validate()

# Test agent creation
agent = new_spec.create_agent('[agent_name]')
assert agent.is_valid()

# Test workflow execution
result = new_spec.execute_workflow('[workflow_name]', test_data)
assert result.success
```
