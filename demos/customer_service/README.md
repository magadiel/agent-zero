    agent_count: 3
    max_complexity: "basic"
  - name: "Level 2"
    agent_count: 2
    max_complexity: "moderate"
  - name: "Level 3"
    agent_count: 1
    max_complexity: "complex"
```

### Adjust Response Templates
Customize responses in `templates/responses/`:

- `resolution.txt` - Problem resolution template
- `escalation.txt` - Escalation notification
- `followup.txt` - Follow-up message

### Configure Routing Rules
Edit `inputs/routing_rules.yaml`:
```yaml
rules:
  - condition: "contains('password') or contains('login')"
    route_to: "level_1"
  - condition: "contains('billing') or contains('payment')"
    route_to: "level_2"
  - condition: "sentiment < -0.5 or priority == 'critical'"
    route_to: "level_3"
```

## Monitoring During Execution

### Real-time Dashboard
Open: http://localhost:8001/dashboard/customer-service

```bash
curl http://localhost:8002/api/agents/status
```

### Resolution Metrics
```bash
curl http://localhost:8002/api/metrics/resolutions
```

## Validation

Run validation to ensure demo quality:
```bash
python validate_demo.py
```

Validation checks:
- ✅ All tickets processed
- ✅ Response time within SLA
- ✅ Quality scores above threshold
- ✅ Customer satisfaction targets met
- ✅ Escalation procedures followed

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Slow response generation
