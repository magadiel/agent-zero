# Control Layer - Ethics, Safety, and Governance

## Overview
The Control Layer implements ethics, safety, and governance systems for the Agile AI Company framework. This layer ensures all agent decisions and actions comply with ethical constraints, safety thresholds, and regulatory requirements.

## ‚úÖ Implemented Components

### Ethics Engine (`ethics_engine.py`) - COMPLETED
The core ethics validation system that evaluates all agent decisions against predefined ethical constraints.

**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ Real-time decision validation
- ‚úÖ Multi-dimensional ethical assessment (harm, privacy, fairness, transparency)
- ‚úÖ Risk scoring and recommendation generation
- ‚úÖ Immutable audit trail with file logging
- ‚úÖ Emergency shutdown capabilities
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test coverage (16 tests passing)

**Usage Example:**
```python
from control.ethics_engine import EthicsEngine, AgentDecision, DecisionType

# Initialize the engine
engine = EthicsEngine()

# Create a decision for validation
decision = AgentDecision(
    agent_id="agent-001",
    decision_type=DecisionType.TASK_EXECUTION,
    action="process_user_data",
    context={
        "explanation": "Analyzing user feedback",
        "personal_data": False,
        "consent": True
    },
    resources_required={"cpu_percent": 30, "memory_mb": 1024}
)

# Validate the decision
result = await engine.validate_decision(decision)

if result.approved:
    print(f"Decision approved: {result.reasoning}")
else:
    print(f"Decision rejected: {result.reasoning}")
```

### Ethical Constraints Configuration (`config/ethical_constraints.yaml`) - COMPLETED
Comprehensive configuration file with 11 categories of ethical rules including:
- Harm prevention policies
- Privacy protection (GDPR compliant)
- Fairness and non-discrimination rules
- Transparency requirements
- Resource limits
- Accountability chains
- Safety mechanisms (kill switches, circuit breakers)
- Learning constraints
- Manipulation prevention
- Sustainability guidelines

## üöß Upcoming Components

### Safety Monitor (`safety_monitor.py`) - PLANNED
- Real-time monitoring of agent activities
- Enforces safety thresholds and limits
- Implements emergency kill switches
- Tracks resource consumption and performance

### Resource Allocator (`resource_allocator.py`) - PLANNED
- Manages computational resource distribution
- Enforces team resource limits
- Implements priority-based allocation
- Handles resource contention and scaling

### Audit Logger (`audit_logger.py`) - PARTIALLY COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ Basic logging to files implemented
- ‚è≥ Cryptographic signatures for integrity (pending)
- ‚è≥ Query interface for compliance (pending)
- ‚è≥ Retention policies and archival (pending)

## Configuration

All control layer components are configured through YAML files in the `/control/config/` directory:
- ‚úÖ `ethical_constraints.yaml` - Ethical rules and principles (COMPLETED)
- ‚è≥ `safety_thresholds.yaml` - Safety limits and triggers (pending)
- ‚è≥ `resource_limits.yaml` - Resource allocation policies (pending)

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
cd /home/magadiel/Desktop/agent-zero/control
python3 tests/test_ethics_engine.py
```

Current test coverage:
- ‚úÖ 16 unit tests passing
- ‚úÖ 2 integration tests passing
- Test scenarios include: harm prevention, privacy violations, fairness checks, transparency requirements, resource limits, emergency shutdown

## API

The Control Layer will expose a REST API (port 8000) for:
- ‚úÖ Ethics validation requests (logic complete, API pending)
- ‚è≥ Safety status monitoring (pending)
- ‚è≥ Resource allocation management (pending)
- ‚è≥ Audit trail queries (pending)

## Security

Current security features:
- ‚úÖ Immutable audit logging
- ‚úÖ Emergency shutdown mechanisms
- ‚úÖ Resource limit enforcement
- ‚úÖ Validation of all decisions

Planned security enhancements:
- ‚è≥ TLS encryption for all communications
- ‚è≥ Authentication for API endpoints
- ‚è≥ Role-based access control (RBAC)
- ‚è≥ Cryptographic signing of audit logs

## Integration

The Control Layer integrates with:
- Coordination Layer - for team orchestration approval
- Execution Teams - for decision validation
- Metrics Layer - for performance monitoring
- Agent-Zero Core - through decision hooks and validation
