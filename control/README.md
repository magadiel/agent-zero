# Control Layer

## Overview
The Control Layer implements ethics, safety, and governance systems for the Agile AI Company framework. This layer ensures all agent decisions and actions comply with ethical constraints, safety thresholds, and regulatory requirements.

## Components

### Ethics Engine (`ethics_engine.py`)
- Validates all agent decisions against ethical constraints
- Maintains immutable ethical principles
- Provides decision approval/veto with reasoning
- Logs all ethical evaluations for audit

### Safety Monitor (`safety_monitor.py`)
- Real-time monitoring of agent activities
- Enforces safety thresholds and limits
- Implements emergency kill switches
- Tracks resource consumption and performance

### Resource Allocator (`resource_allocator.py`)
- Manages computational resource distribution
- Enforces team resource limits
- Implements priority-based allocation
- Handles resource contention and scaling

### Audit Logger (`audit_logger.py`)
- Creates immutable audit trails
- Implements cryptographic signatures for integrity
- Provides query interface for compliance
- Manages retention policies and archival

## Configuration

All control layer components are configured through YAML files in the `/control/config/` directory:
- `ethical_constraints.yaml` - Ethical rules and principles
- `safety_thresholds.yaml` - Safety limits and triggers
- `resource_limits.yaml` - Resource allocation policies

## API

The Control Layer exposes a REST API (port 8000) for:
- Ethics validation requests
- Safety status monitoring
- Resource allocation management
- Audit trail queries

## Security

- All communications encrypted with TLS
- Authentication required for all API endpoints
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Integration

The Control Layer integrates with:
- Coordination Layer - for team orchestration approval
- Execution Teams - for decision validation
- Metrics Layer - for performance monitoring
